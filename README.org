* Odin-Mode for Emacs
Odin syntax highlighting and auto-completions for the Odin Programming language

this was made because I needed one, however I really dont know what I am doing, give it a try and see if it works for you, if there is something missing its very easy to add new syntax.
I am not sure if I will update this further maybe maybe not.
* directions
just add (load-file "File location here") to your init
